## Disclosure
I used AI tools (ChatGPT) to guide in the development of this project.The AI was used for code generating, debugging support, and documentation formatting.

## Prompt Links
The full log of prompts used for code generation and debugging can be found here:

## Verification
I verified the accuracy of the AI-generated components through the following methods:
1.  **Manual Math Checks**: Verified that the `fidelity` function correctly implements the quantum fidelity formula.
2.  **Constraint Validation**: Confirmed that all generated density matrices have Unit Trace and are Positive Semi-Definite.
3.  **Baseline Comparison**: Validated the model's results by comparing them against a standard Linear Inversion benchmark for Bell States.
